Introduction & Overview

Welcome to the documentation for SF-CHAMP (San Francisco CHained Modeling Process).

The model consists of numerous model steps and sub-models that work together to produce travel demand estimates. There are two primary types of models within SF-CHAMP: demand models and supply models. The demand models take the synthetic population, land use data, and travel accessibilities as inputs and estimate travel decisions. The supply models assign trips to transportation networks and simulate how the networks operate. The SF-CHAMP model consists of iterative looping between the demand and supply models. SF-CHAMP 6.0 is configured to complete six iterative loops through the demand and supply models. SF-CHAMPâ€™s demand and supply models are described in greater detail, below.
